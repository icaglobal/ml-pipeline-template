# Overview

This directory, `statemachine/`, requires a configuration file for the state machine, typically named `state-machine-definition.json`. Given the diversity in state machine configurations and the fact that JSON files do not support comments, this file cannot be easily templatized.

## Configuration File

You will find an example configuration file named `state-machine-definition.json` in this directory. This file serves as a starting point for your state machine configuration. Customize it to fit your specific requirements:

1. **Adjust Parameters**: Update the parameter values to match your environment and use case.
2. **Rename States**: Change state names to clearly reflect their operations.
3. **Modify Structure**: Add, remove, or modify states to build the desired workflow.

## Using AWS State Machine Editor

To simplify the design and modification process, use the "Edit" functionality in AWS Step Functions:

1. **Design in GUI**: Use the AWS graphical interface to design your state machine.
2. **Export Configuration**: After designing, export the configuration as a JSON file and save it as `state-machine-definition.json`.
